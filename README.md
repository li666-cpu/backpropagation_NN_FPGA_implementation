# backpropagation_NN_FPGA_implementation
This is the final project for the BP NN FPGA implementation 
For details, please refer to the report (pdf file)
Basically, you can just open the FPGA QUARTUS project file, or you can 
open the simulation\modelsim\XOR_run_msim_gate_verilog.do to run the simulation on 
MODELSIM. GOODLUCK!! please feel free to contact us if you have any questions!
